# countryballs_gamebot
Source code for the bot "countryballs_gamebot"

If you are a beginner, then for the bot to work you need to insert the bot token from the bot father into the field: “Bot token”.

Lasted version: 1.2

I used the following libraries as a basis: "node-telegram-bot-api".
For proper operation, you need to write: "npm install node-telegram-bot-api".
